feat: Refine player grouping and fix frontend errors

This commit addresses several issues related to player grouping and frontend stability:

- **Player Grouping Logic:**
  - Refined the `handleAddPlayerToGroup` function in `TournamentManager.js` to correctly add players to the next available slot across rounds.
  - Re-introduced per-round checks to prevent players from being added to multiple groups within the same round.
  - Ensured proper breaking from loops to prevent incorrect state updates.

- **Frontend Error Resolution:**
  - Fixed the "No available slots in any group for any round" spurious alert by correctly managing the `playerWasAdded` flag.
  - Resolved ESLint "not defined" errors for `playerWasAdded` and `sortedCourses` by re-adding their declarations.
  - Corrected `SyntaxError: Unsyntactic break` by refactoring the player adding logic into a helper function, replacing labeled `break` statements with early `return`s.

- **New Group Management Components:**
  - Added `GroupModal.js` and `GroupModal.css` for enhanced group management functionality.

- **Backend and Database Updates:**
  - Updated `golfapp-server/app.py` with model definitions and potentially other backend logic (related to previous SQLAlchemy/SSL fixes).
  - Reorganized Alembic migrations, including the deletion of old migration files and the addition of new ones, along with modifications to `alembic.ini`. These database changes will require an upgrade on the Render PostgreSQL database.
