fix: Resolve scorecard display and submission issues

Addresses several bugs related to scorecard display and score submission:
- Corrected frontend logic to properly load and display existing hole scores when switching courses.
- Optimized frontend data fetching for existing rounds by making a single API call.
- Fixed backend `record_hole_scores` function to correctly initialize and accumulate summary scores, resolving `UnboundLocalError` and `NameError`.
- Ensured `HoleScore` entries are updated (upserted) rather than always inserted.
